# LINUX Week 01 

## Preparation

This is what we're gonna use in this class

* Virtual Box
* CentOS 7

## What Is CentOS

CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free and open-source community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## What Is VirtualBox
Oracle VM VirtualBox is a type-2 hypervisor for x86 virtualization developed by Oracle Corporation.

VirtualBox may be installed on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, and OpenSolaris. There are also ports to FreeBSD and Genode. It supports the creation and management of guest virtual machines running Windows, Linux, BSD, OS/2, Solaris, Haiku, and OSx86 and limited virtualization of macOS guests on Apple hardware. For some guest operating systems, a "Guest Additions" package of device drivers and system applications is available, which typically improves performance, especially that of graphics, and allows changing the resolution of the guest OS automatically when the window of the virtual machine on the host OS is resized.

## Where To Download
* Virtual Box = https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* CentOS 7    = https://www.centos.org/download/

## Start
* Install VirtualBox
* Add the Extension Pack to the VM Virtual Box to create a new virtual machine
* Choose RedHat or other Linux, the memory allocation is more than 1024, and the disk uses the default 8GB
* Select the default hard disk type "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)"
* If the storage hard disk (above 50G) is dynamic, it will be allocated according to the usage. Generally, this is selected. If the hard disk space is large enough, you can also choose a fixed size, and the speed will be faster.
* After creation, change the options in the system you can adjust for yourself
* After you adjust the setting go to setting - storage - controller IDE - select empty - choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file and select the CentOS7 that you already download
* Start the machine and select install CentOS7
* Adjust your own CentOS settings
